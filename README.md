### Introduction
We are two students who work on the course "Design of dynamic web systems" in LTU designated M7011E.

### The Project
The course work is about simulating a small scaled electricity market. Three kind of actors are to be taken in account in the similation:
* Consumers: these houses consume electricity from the market 
* Prosumers: these houses produce energy thanks to there own a little wind turbine. The inhabitants can store this energy in a battery and use it for there own consumption. They can sell the leftover to the market. They can also buy electricity from market if there wind turbine is not sufficient.
* Manager: there is one manager for the whole electrical grid.
