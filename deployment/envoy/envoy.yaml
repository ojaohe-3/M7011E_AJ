# thanks to https://github.com/nicholasjackson/envoy-experiments/tree/master/routing-simple for instruction and explanation on http routing. This is just the tip of the ice berg and im just starting to learning.
# additional configuration is nescessary for scalability, as new cluster has to be defined, a handler that deals with expanding docker swarm etc. unlikley this project ever reach that scope.
